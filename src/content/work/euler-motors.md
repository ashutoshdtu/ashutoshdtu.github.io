My tenure with [Euler Motors](https://eulermotors.com) involved an ambitious project â€“ the inception of the first **Advanced Driver-Assistance Systems (ADAS)** and **Self-Driving Electric Vehicle (EV)**. Despite having to leave midway due to health conditions, my contribution to the project was significant and marked by innovation and technical excellence.

[Euler Motors](https://eulermotors.com), a forward-thinking automobile company dedicated to sustainable energy solutions, presented a complex challenge: designing a pioneering ADAS and Self-Driving EV. Working with cutting-edge technology, my focus was on scalability, precision, and safety. I designed a **data collection pipeline** essential for training the self-driving software and worked on a low-latency **car-to-pilot video streaming** system, ensuring the smooth transfer of real-time visual data from the vehicle to the pilot. 

One of my significant achievements was the creation of a **robust teleoperation system** that allowed remote control of the vehicle, adding an additional layer of safety and control.

Though I couldn't stay to see the project through to its completion, my contributions laid a strong foundation for Euler Motors' ADAS and Self-Driving EV project. This endeavor exemplifies my dedication to technological innovation and my capability to deliver high-impact solutions, even when faced with personal adversity.
