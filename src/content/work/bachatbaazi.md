As a **Technology Advisor** for [BachatBaazi](https://bachatbaazi.com), a dynamic auction platform, I led the team in a comprehensive and complete overhaul of the platform's cloud infrastructure. The challenge was to reconstruct the entire infrastructure from scratch, while managing a small team of developers. 

[BachatBaazi](https://bachatbaazi.com), an auction and group-purchase e-commerce app, required a robust, scalable, and highly efficient backend system to handle a large and rapidly increasing user base. The mission was not only to create a backend infrastructure that could support the current demands but also to future-proof it to seamlessly handle an anticipated surge in user interaction and data volumes.

In collaboration with the team, I meticulously planned and executed the redesign of the entire backend. Implementing a scalable web architecture and leveraging my skills in DevOps and automation, I led the development and release of an entirely new suite of backend services.

The result was a striking improvement in the application's performance, enhancing throughput and concurrency by over ten times on similar hardware. The success of this project demonstrated the power of strategic planning, effective team leadership, and skilled execution. 

Working on BachatBaazi's backend services project, I reaffirmed my commitment to innovation, efficiency, and creating value through technology, enabling businesses to optimize their operations and achieve their goals.
