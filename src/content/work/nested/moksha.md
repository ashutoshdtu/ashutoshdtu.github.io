The creation of a revolutionary web-app for Moksha Designs stands as one of the notable highlights of my career. Moksha Designs needed a solution to automate the process of conducting photoshoots for their garments in real-time and without the need for a human model.

As the lead of this project, I spearheaded the release and development of the entire product. This involved overseeing all stages from ideation to execution, effectively translating the client's vision into a functional and highly efficient product. 

In addition to the technical responsibilities, I handled client management and product management, ensuring a seamless flow of communication and keeping the project aligned with the set objectives. 

The resulting web-app transformed Moksha Design's product photography process, showcasing the power of technology in reshaping traditional business practices and offering novel solutions. 

Through this project, I have reinforced my commitment to leveraging technology for creating efficient, innovative solutions that redefine operational processes and drive business growth.
