My tenure as a **Co-Founder** and **Head of Engineering** at [Veda Labs](https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/veda-labs) marked a significant chapter in my career. Veda Labs was an AI startup that provided state-of-the-art **video analytics** solutions to retail stores and warehouses to unlock critical insights into **foot traffic**, **visitor demographics**, and behavior patterns within their stores. As part of the founding team, I had a significant role in shaping the company's technical vision and translating it into a scalable product.

Utilizing advanced video analytics, Veda Labs delivered an array of powerful features. From accurately counting the number of visitors to identifying the **gender distribution** of customers, businesses gained unparalleled visibility into their clientele. Furthermore, Veda Labs offered detailed **age range analysis**, allowing retailers to tailor their marketing strategies and improve customer experiences.

Through heatmap visualizations, Veda Labs offered a unique perspective on **customer movement within stores** allowing our clients to discover which areas attract the most attention and optimize store layouts accordingly. 

I spearheaded the design and development of **all web services** and the **entire backend architecture** of the company, managing a dedicated team of developers. This involved setting up development processes, creating RESTful & RPC micro-services and managing entire cloud infrastructure.

One of the critical projects I led was the development of a customizable customer dashboard. This user-friendly interface facilitated seamless interaction with our services and provided clients with valuable insights at their fingertips.

Our client portfolio included industry giants like [Flipkart](https://flipkart.com), [Viacom](https://www.viacom18.com/), [Mahindra](https://www.mahindra.com/), [L&T](https://www.larsentoubro.com/), [V-Mart](https://www.vmartretail.com/), and [NASSCOM](https://nasscom.in/), underscoring our success in delivering top-tier solutions. This journey reiterated my passion for creating groundbreaking solutions that redefine industry standards.
