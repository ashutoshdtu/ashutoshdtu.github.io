My tenure as a Co-Founder and Head of Engineering at Veda Labs marked a significant chapter in my career. Veda Labs is an AI startup that offers cutting-edge video analytics solutions to retail stores and warehouses. As part of the founding team, I had a significant role in shaping the company's technical vision and translating it into a scalable product.

I spearheaded the design and development of all web services and the entire backend architecture of the company, managing a dedicated team of developers. This involved setting up development processes, creating RESTful & RPC micro-services, deploying helm charts over kubernetes clusters, and auto-generating SDKs & documentation.

One of the critical projects I led was the development of a customizable customer dashboard. This user-friendly interface facilitated seamless interaction with our services and provided clients with valuable insights at their fingertips.

Our client portfolio includes industry giants like Flipkart, Viacom, Mahindra, L&T, V-Mart, and NASSCOM, underscoring our success in delivering top-tier solutions. This journey reiterated my passion for creating groundbreaking solutions that redefine industry standards.
