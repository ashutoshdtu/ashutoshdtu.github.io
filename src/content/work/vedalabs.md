My tenure as a **Co-Founder** and **Head of Engineering** at [Veda Labs](https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/veda-labs) marked a significant chapter in my career. Veda Labs is an AI startup that offers cutting-edge video analytics solutions to retail stores and warehouses. As part of the founding team, I had a significant role in shaping the company's technical vision and translating it into a scalable product.

I spearheaded the design and development of **all web services** and the **entire backend architecture** of the company, managing a dedicated team of developers. This involved setting up development processes, creating RESTful & RPC micro-services, deploying helm charts over kubernetes clusters, and auto-generating SDKs & documentation.

One of the critical projects I led was the development of a customizable customer dashboard. This user-friendly interface facilitated seamless interaction with our services and provided clients with valuable insights at their fingertips.

Our client portfolio includes industry giants like [Flipkart](https://flipkart.com), [Viacom](https://www.viacom18.com/), [Mahindra](https://www.mahindra.com/), [L&T](https://www.larsentoubro.com/), [V-Mart](https://www.vmartretail.com/), and [NASSCOM](https://nasscom.in/), underscoring our success in delivering top-tier solutions. This journey reiterated my passion for creating groundbreaking solutions that redefine industry standards.
